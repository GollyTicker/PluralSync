# Source Agnostic Updates

The current software is focused on the SimplyPlural model of how systems and fronts are tracked.
This is due to historic reasons, as this project simply started as a SimplyPlural -> VRChat sync.

Now, many people also want PluralKit -> SimplyPlural or some fields sourced from PluralKit and others from SimplyPlural.

For this, we want to change the structure, so that SP -> * isn't hardcoded anymore and that we have
more flexible * -> * updates.

# PluralSync - Sync your plural system across platforms

A cloud service where users can automatically sync their plural systems' fronting status
between various system managers and social platforms such as [SimplyPlural](https://apparyllis.com/), [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/), [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/), [Discord](https://discord.com) or their own website. Users of system managers (plural systems, DID/OSDD systems, etc.) benefit from this as it makes it easier for them to communicate who's fronting while only
needing to update their fronting on Simply Plural.

A public *alpha* version can be found online at [public-test.pluralsync.ayake.net](https://public-test.pluralsync.ayake.net). (*Use this at your own risk.*) This is already used by many people and the users are growing every week.

Currently the following updates are supported:
* SimplyPlural to VRChat Status
* SimplyPlural to Discord Status / Discord Rich Presence
* SimplyPlural to Website with fronter names and avatars
* SimplyPlural to PluralKit Fronters Switch 

We, the developers, take data security and privacy seriously. The data to synchronise between the services
is stored encrypted and at industry-standard security. Self hosting is possible if you have some tech knowledge.
